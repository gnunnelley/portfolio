I am a recent graduate from UC Santa Barbara with a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science. I have a solid foundation in statistics and its computing applications. With a particular focus on geospatial data types, my work experience has honed my skills in both data analysis and visualization. Iâ€™m interested in fields like data science, research analytics, or software engineering, or related fields that geospatial concepts. I am actively seeking opportunities that align with my interest in spatial science.
