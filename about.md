I am a recent graduate from UC Santa Barbara with a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science. I have a solid foundation in statistics and its computing applications due to my educational background. I’m interested in working in data analytics, data science, and related fields. I am primarily interested in specializing in spatial data analytics or science to leverage my experience in working with geospatial data types. I am seeking roles that combine my interests in computer vision, data visualization, and spatial data science. 


“Skills”:

- Proficient in Python, R, and SQL
- Worked with Python libraries such as Pandas, OpenCV, and GDAL
- Familiar with ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online
