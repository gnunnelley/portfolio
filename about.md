Recent UC Santa Barbara Graduate | Data Science

I am a recent graduate from UC Santa Barbara with a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science. My academic background has equipped me with a solid foundation in statistics and its computer applications. I’m interested in working in Data Analytics, Data Science, and related fields. My work experience, with a particular focus on geospatial data types, has honed my skills in both data analysis and visualization.


“Skills”:

- Proficient in Python, R, and SQL
- Worked with Python libraries such as Pandas, OpenCV, and GDAL
- Familiar with ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online


My interests branch into computer vision and geography. I am eager to apply my skills to geospatial applications from the scope of data science. I am seeking entry level roles that allows me contribute to the field of geospatial data science or related fields.
